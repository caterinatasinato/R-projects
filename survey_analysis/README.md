# Canadian Post-COVID-19 Readiness to resume their behavior
## Project Overview

This project analyzes the readiness of the Canadian population to resume daily activities in the wake of COVID-19, with a focus on how preferences differ based on demographic and behavioral factors. By utilizing survey data, this study explores variables such as gender, age, region, and comfort levels in returning to social, work, and leisure environments. The insights generated aim to support informed policy decisions and targeted communication strategies as Canada continues its post-pandemic recovery.

## Project Goals

- **Identify Influencing Factors**: Examine the factors that affect Canadians' readiness to return to normal activities.
- **Explore Demographic Differences**: Analyze how readiness varies across different age groups, genders, and regions.
- **Inform Policy**: Provide insights that can aid in post-pandemic policy and communication strategies.

## Dataset

- **Demographics**: Gender, age, region.
- **Behavioral Data**: Comfort levels with resuming activities (social gatherings, work, etc.).

## Project Structure

- **Data**: Raw and cleaned datasets.
- **Scripts**: R scripts for data preprocessing and analysis.
- **Notebooks**: R Markdown files for detailed analysis and findings.
- **Reports**: Final report with visualizations and insights.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Install necessary packages: `install.packages(c('tidyverse', 'ggplot2', 'dplyr'))`
3. Run the R Markdown notebooks to perform the analysis.

## Future Work

- Longitudinal analysis to track changes in readiness over time.
- Compare findings with other countries to identify global trends.
