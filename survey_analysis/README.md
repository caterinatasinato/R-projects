# Canadian Post-COVID-19 Readiness and Media Trust Analysis

## Project Overview

This project consists of two distinct analyses focusing on Canadian society:

1. **Post-COVID-19 Readiness**: Analyzing the readiness of Canadians to resume their daily activities after the pandemic. The analysis looks at how demographic and behavioral factors influence people's comfort levels in returning to social, work, and leisure activities.
   
2. **Media Recognition and Trust**: Investigating the level of trust and recognition that Canadians place in various media outlets. The analysis explores how demographic variables like age, gender, and region affect media consumption patterns and trust in different news sources.

These analyses aim to provide insights that can inform policy decisions, improve public communication, and support a more accurate understanding of Canadian behavior post-pandemic and regarding media interactions.

## Project Goals

- **COVID-19 Readiness**: 
  - Identify factors influencing people's readiness to return to daily activities post-pandemic.
  - Understand behavioral differences based on demographics (age, gender, region).
  - Provide insights to inform public health communication and policies for post-pandemic recovery.

- **Media Recognition and Trust**: 
  - Analyze media consumption patterns across different demographics.
  - Identify key sources of trust and skepticism in Canadian media.
  - Offer recommendations for media organizations and policy-makers to improve engagement and trust.

## Dataset

- **COVID-19 Readiness**: Includes demographic data (gender, age, region) and behavioral data (comfort levels with resuming activities like social gatherings, work, etc.).
- **Media Trust**: Contains demographic data and behavioral data related to media consumption, trust in media outlets, and perceptions of credibility.

## Project Structure

- **Data**: Contains raw and cleaned datasets for both analyses.
- **COVID-19 Readiness Analysis**: Contains R scripts, R Markdown files for detailed analysis, and final reports related to the readiness to resume activities post-COVID.
- **Media Trust Analysis**: Contains R scripts, R Markdown files for detailed analysis, and final reports related to media trust and recognition.
- **Reports**: Final reports for both analyses with visualizations and key insights.

## Key Findings

### COVID-19 Readiness
- **Demographic Trends**: Older Canadians are more hesitant to return to social activities compared to younger age groups.
- **Regional Differences**: People in urbanized regions show higher readiness to return to work and social events.
- **Social Activities**: Most respondents are comfortable with returning to outdoor social activities but are less confident about attending large indoor events.

### Media Trust and Recognition
- **Trust in Media**: Canadians aged 18-34 tend to trust digital news sources more than traditional media, while older generations show a stronger preference for TV and print media.
- **Regional Differences**: Media trust is higher in certain provinces, particularly in those with a greater diversity of local news outlets.
- **Misinformation Concerns**: Trust in the media decreases when misinformation is perceived, especially in online and social media sources.

## Conclusion

The insights gained from both analyses can be used to inform better communication strategies in the post-pandemic era and help media organizations understand the evolving landscape of public trust and media consumption in Canada.
