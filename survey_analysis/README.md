# Canadian Post-COVID-19 Readiness to resume their behavior
## Project Overview

This project analyzes the readiness of the Canadian population to resume daily activities in the wake of COVID-19, with a focus on how preferences differ based on demographic and behavioral factors. By utilizing survey data, this study explores variables such as gender, age, region, and comfort levels in returning to social, work, and leisure environments. The insights generated aim to support informed policy decisions and targeted communication strategies as Canada continues its post-pandemic recovery.
